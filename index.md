I am a Pre-doctoral Researcher for Erin M. Kelley and Gregory Lane, Assistant Professors of Economics at the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy.  

I'm interested in the fields of environmental and development economics with a special interest in studying policy interventions for climate resilience in developing countries. 

I graduated with an MSc in Economic and Social Sciences (MSc-ESS) from Bocconi University in April 2024.
